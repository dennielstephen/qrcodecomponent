## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

The use of HTML5 semantics is what I learned new today. Also I learned that css has a gap and word-spacing component. Lastly I need to master the use of rem that is why I rarely use px here.

```html
<main class="qr-container"></main>
```
```css
.qr-container {
  gap: 0.2rem;
}
```
